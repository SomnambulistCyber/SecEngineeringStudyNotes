Where did these notes come from? See the [README]([README.md](https://github.com/BWC-Somnambulist/SecEngineeringStudyNotes/blob/main/README.md)).

# Learning Tips 

- [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course on Coursera is amazing and very useful. Take the full course, or read this [summary](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/learnings-from-learning-how-to-learn-19d149920dc4) on Medium.

- **Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"**
	- Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its. 
	- One term per post-it. 
	- "To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
	- I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
	- I focused on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
	- I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations. 
	- Using paper reduces distractions.

- **How to review concepts**
	- Use spaced-repetition.
	- Don't immediately look up the answer, EVEN IF you have never seen the term before. Ask yourself what the term means. Guess the answer. Then look it up.
	- Review terms *all the time*. You can review items in your head at any time. If I was struggling to fall asleep, I'd go through terms in my head and explained them to myself. 100% success rate of falling asleep in less than 10 minutes, works every time. 

- **Target your learning**
	- Think *hard* about what specific team you are going for, what skills do they want? If you aren't sure, then ask someone who will definitely know.
	- Always focus on the areas you struggle with the most *first* in a study session. Then move on to easier or more familiar topics. 

- **Identify what you need to work on** 
	- Spend more time doing the difficult things.
	- If you're weak on coding and you find yourself avoiding it, then spend most of your study time doing that.

- **Read**
	- Read relevant books (you don't have to read back to back).
	- When looking up things online, avoid going more than two referral links deep - this will save you from browser tab hell.

- **Mental health**
	- Take care of your basic needs first - sleep, eat well, drink water, gentle exercise. You know yourself, so do what's best for you.
	- You are more than your economic output, remember to separate your self worth from your paycheque. 
	- See interviews for what they are - they are *not* a measure of you being "good enough".


# Interviewing Tips 

- **Interview questions**
	- Interview questions are intentionally vague. This is to encourage questions.
	- Ask clarifying questions 
	- Questions reveal how you approach problems.
	- Write down notes about the question. This is so you don't forget details and only partially answer, or give the wrong answer.
	- Interviews should be more like a conversation with a lot of back and forth, thoroughly explore scenarios together and avoid jumping too fast to a solution.
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- **Interviewers test depth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions about technical details on topics to the point where it'll be hard to answer. This is okay, try your best to work through it and say what you're thinking.
		- Interviewers often aren't looking for specific answers, they just want to see how deeply you know a topic.
		- Approach the question from a low level and even ask your interviewer if you need to add more details before moving on.
	- **Interviewers test breadth of knowledge**
		- There will be questions related to the role you're applying for and some that aren't. This is to explore breadth of knowledge. 
		- Try your best to explore the scenarios and ask questions. It's very important to say your thinking aloud, you might be on the right track.

- **Show comprehension**
	- Try to always ask clarifying questions even if you think you already know the answer. You might learn some nuance that even improves your idea.
	- Always repeat the question back to the interviewer to both check your understanding and give yourself thinking time.
	- *"Okay, I'll repeat back the question so I can check my understanding…"*
	- *"Just to clarify…"*
	- *"I just want to check I heard correctly…"*
	
- **State your assumptions**
	- Your interviewer will provide feedback if your assumptions are unreasonable.
	- *"I am going to assume that the organisation is collecting x,y,z logs from hosts and storing these for at least 90 days…"* 
	- *"Can I make the assumption that…?"*
	- *"Let's say that we can get x,y,z information…"*

- **When asked a question you're not sure of the answer to right away, try these phrases:**
	- *"I don't know but if I had to invent it, it would be like this…"*
	- *"I don't know that exactly but I know something about a similar subject / sub component…"*
	- *"This is what's popping into my mind right now is…"*
	- *"The only thing that is coming to mind is…"* 
	- *"I know a lot about [similar thing], I could talk about that instead? Would that be okay?"*

- **Say what you are thinking**
	- The interviewer can only make an evaluation on your suitability for the job based on the things you *say*. 
	- If you don't say your thought process aloud, then the interviewer doesn't know what you know. 
	- You may well be on the right track with an answer. You'll be kicking yourself afterwards if you later realise you were but didn't say anything (I missed out on an internship because of this!).
	- Write pseudo code for your coding solution so you don't have to hold everything in your head.
	- *"Right now I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I am thinking about different approaches, for example…"*
	- *"I keep coming back to [subject/idea/thing] but I think that's not the right direction. I am thinking about…"*
	- *"I'm interested in this idea that…"*

- **Reduce cognitive load**
	- Take notes on the question and assumptions during the interview.
	- If the infrastructure is complicated, draw up what you think it looks like. 
	- Write pseudocode. 
	- Write tests and expected output for code you write, test your code against it. 

- **Prepare**
	- Make a checklist that reminds you of what to do for each question, something like:
		- Listen to interview question
		- Take notes on the question
		- Repeat the question
		- Ask clarifying questions
		- State any assumptions
	- Prepare questions that you want to ask your interviewers at the end of the interview so you don't need to think of them on the spot on the day. Since an interview is also for you to know more about the workplace, I asked questions about the worst parts of the job. 
	- Bring some small snacks in a box or container that isn't noisy and distracting. A little bit of sugar throughout the interviews can help your problem solving abilities. 
	- Stay hydrated - and take a toilet break between every interview if you need to (it's good to take a quiet moment).

- **Do practice interviews**
	- Do them until they feel more comfortable and you can easily talk through problems.
	- Ask your friends/peers to give you really hard questions that you definitely don't know how to answer.
	- Practice being in the very uncomfortable position where you have no idea about the topic you've been asked. Work through it from first principles.
	- Practice speaking aloud everything you know about a topic, even details you think might be irrelevant. 
	- Doooo theeeeemmm yes they can be annoying to organise but it is *worth it*.

### Interviewers are potential friends and they want to help you get the job, they are on your side. Let them help you, ask them questions, recite everything you know on a topic and *say your thought process out loud*.


# Networking 

- OSI Model
	- Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
	- Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
	- Network; layer 3 (Routing).
	- Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
	- Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).	
- Firewalls
	- Rules to prevent incoming and outgoing connections.	
	- Know the hierarchy of rules in a list
- NAT 
	- Useful to understand IPv4 vs IPv6.
	- NAT (Network Address Translation):
	- Technique for converting private IP addresses to public IP addresses
	- Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address, Increases security and saves IPv4 address space
- IPv4
	- Uses 32-bit addressing, offering ~4.3 billion unique addresses
	- Not enough for the growing number of internet devices
	- Most common, but gradually being replaced by IPv6
- IPv6
	- Uses 128-bit addressing, offering a massive number of unique addresses
	- Improved security and efficiency compared to IPv4, potential provacy issues. Much more difficult to enumerate IPv6 Addresses
	- Slowly being adopted globally
- DNS
	- (53)
	- Requests to DNS are usually UDP, unless the server gives a redirect notice asking for a TCP connection. Look up in cache happens first. DNS exfiltration. Using raw IP addresses means no DNS logs, but there are HTTP logs. DNS sinkholes.
	- In a reverse DNS lookup, PTR might contain- 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which will map to  208.80.152.2. DNS lookups start at the end of the string and work backwards, which is why the IP address is backwards in PTR.
- DNS exfiltration 
	- Sending data as subdomains. 
	- 26856485f6476a567567c6576e678.badguy.com
	- Doesn’t show up in http logs. 
- DNS configs
	- Start of Authority (SOA).
	- IP addresses (A and AAAA).
	- SMTP mail exchangers (MX).
	- Name servers (NS).
	- Pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR).
	- Domain name aliases (CNAME).
- ARP
	- Pair MAC address with IP Address for IP connections. 
- DHCP
	- UDP (67 - Server, 68 - Client)
	- Dynamic address allocation (allocated by router).
	- `DHCPDISCOVER` -> `DHCPOFFER` -> `DHCPREQUEST` -> `DHCPACK`
- Multiplex 
	- Timeshare, statistical share, just useful to know it exists, and what it accomplishes.
- Traceroute 
	- Usually uses UDP, but might also use ICMP Echo Request or TCP SYN. TTL, or hop-limit.
	- Initial hop-limit is 128 for windows and 64 for *nix. Destination returns ICMP Echo Reply. 
- Nmap 
	- Network scanning tool, know what it can do, and some of the malicious and non-malicious uses.
- Intercepts (PitM - Person in the middle)
	- Understand PKI (public key infrastructure in relation to this)
- PK (Public Key Infrastructure)
	- System for managing digital certificates and encryption keys
	- Ensures secure communication and authentication over the internet
	- Relies on a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to issue and validate certificates
	- User A wants to send an encrypted message to User B
	- User A obtains User B's public key from their digital certificate
	- User A encrypts the message with User B's public key
	- User B receives the encrypted message and decrypts it with their private key
- VPN 
	- Hide traffic from ISP but exposes traffic to VPN provider.
- Tor 
	- Traffic is obvious on a network. For example:
	- Distinctive packet sizes and timing patterns: Tor's use of fixed-size cells (512 bytes) and specific timing intervals for relaying traffic can be used to identify its presence on a network.
	- Entry and exit nodes: Security analysts can monitor known entry and exit nodes of the Tor network. If traffic is observed connecting to or from these nodes, it is likely to be Tor traffic.
	- TLS fingerprinting: Tor uses specific TLS (Transport Layer Security) cipher suites and parameters that can be identified through deep packet inspection, which allows analysts to detect Tor traffic.
	- Protocol fingerprinting: Tor uses its own protocol (the Tor protocol) for communication, which can be detected through protocol analysis and traffic monitoring.
	- How do organised crime investigators find people on tor networks [Example: Founder of Silk Road](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/)
- Proxy  
	- Why 7 proxies won’t help you. (correlation attacks/log retention/proxy trustworthiness)
- BGP
	- Border Gateway Protocol.
	- Holds the internet together.
	- A standardised exterior gateway protocol that manages how packets are routed across the internet by exchanging routing and reachability information between autonomous systems. BGP allows routers to determine the most efficient path to transmit data across the internet and dynamically adjust to network changes or failures. BGP is the protocol responsible for maintaining the global routing table and ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission across the internet.
- Network traffic tools
	- Wireshark
	- Tcpdump
	- BurpSuite
- HTTP/S 
	- (80, 443)
	- Common HTTP Response Codes:
	-  1xx Here's what I will do
	-  2xx Here's what you want
	-  3xx I don't have what you want but I know who does
	-  4xx It didn't work, but it's your fault
	-  5xx It didn't work and it's my fault
- SSL/TLS
	- (443) 
	- Super important to learn this, includes learning about handshakes, encryption, signing, certificate authorities, trust systems. A good [primer](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1) on all these concepts and algorithms is made available by the Dutch cybersecurity center. Understand how the following attacks/vulnerabilities can be mitigated.
	- POODLE  (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption):
	- Affects SSLv3 and relies on a padding oracle attack
	- Exploits the way SSLv3 handles padding in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode
	- BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS):
	- Affects TLS 1.0 and SSLv3, targeting the use of CBC mode
	- Exploits a vulnerability in the way the initialization vector (IV) is selected in these protocols
	- CRIME  (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy):
	- Exploits the use of data compression in SSL/TLS and SPDY protocols
	- Relies on observing changes in the size of compressed data to infer information about the plaintext
	- BREACH  (Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext):
	- Similar to CRIME, but targets HTTP response compression (e.g., gzip)
	- Exploits the way compression algorithms reveal information about the plaintext
	- HEARTBLEED (no fancy mnenomic):
	- Affects OpenSSL, a widely used implementation of SSL/TLS
	- Caused by a buffer over-read in the TLS heartbeat extension, which leaks sensitive memory contents
- TCP/UDP
	- Web traffic, chat, voip, traceroute.
	- TCP will throttle back if packets are lost but UDP doesn't. 
	- Streaming can slow network TCP connections sharing the same network.
- ICMP 
	- Ping and traceroute.
- Mail
	- SMTP (25, 587, 465)
	- IMAP (143, 993)
	- POP3 (110, 995)
- SSH 
	- (22)
	- Handshake uses asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric key.
- Telnet
	- (23, 992)
	- Allows remote communication with hosts.
- ARP  
	- Who is 0.0.0.0? Tell 0.0.0.1.
	- Linking IP address to MAC, Looks at cache first.
- DHCP 
	- (67, 68) (546, 547)
	- Dynamic (leases IP address, not persistent).
	- Automatic (leases IP address and remembers MAC and IP pairing in a table).
	- Manual (static IP set by administrator).
- IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
	- Developed as a near real time text based communicatio  protocol that enables users to chat in channels or groups, as well as in private conversations. 
	- Understand use by hackers (botnets).
	- Primarily used as C2 (Command and Control), a channel is used to send commands to numerous clients.
	- Ease of anonymity
	- IRC supports various scripting languages, allowing for automation.
	- Can be decentralised and resilient to takedowns or disruptions.
	- Should be noted that in recent years actors have moved to more advanced and stealthy communication methods such as P2P networks, custom protocols, and encrypyted messaging platforms.
- FTP/SFTP 
	- (21, 22)
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
	- Used to communicate between processes on different workstations.
	- Predefined set of tasks that remote clients can execute.
	- Used inside orgs. 
- Service ports
	- 0 - 1023: Reserved for common services - sudo required. 
	- 1024 - 49151: Registered ports used for IANA-registered services. 
	- 49152 - 65535: Dynamic ports that can be used for anything. 
- HTTP Header
	- | Verb | Path | HTTP version |
	- Domain
	- Accept
	- Accept-language
	- Accept-charset
	- Accept-encoding(compression type)
	- Connection- close or keep-alive
	- Referrer
	- Return address
	- Expected Size?
- HTTP Response Header
	- HTTP version
	- Status Codes: 
		- 1xx: Informational Response
		- 2xx: Successful
		- 3xx: Redirection
		- 4xx: Client Error
		- 5xx: Server Error
	- Type of data in response 
	- Type of encoding
	- Language 
	- Charset
- UDP Header
	- Source port
	- Destination port
	- Length
	- Checksum
- Broadcast domains and collision domains.
	- This is fairly basic networking knowledge that it is expected for you to know.
	- Its worth knowing about LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution), allows name resolution without the requirement of a DNS Server. This allows impersonation on a network.
- Root stores
- CAM table overflow
	- Occurs when an attacker connects to a single or multiple switch ports and then runs a tool that mimics the existence of thousands of random MAC addresses on those switch ports. The switch enters these into the CAM table, and eventually the CAM table fills to capacity.


# Web Application 

- Same Origin Policy
	- Only accept requests from the same origin domain.  
- CORS 
	- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Can specify allowed origins in HTTP headers. Sends a pre-flight request with options set asking if the server approves, and if the server approves, then the actual request is sent (eg. should client send auth cookies).
- HSTS
	- HTTP Strict Transport Security is a policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking
	- Policies, eg what websites use HTTPS.
- Cert transparency 
	- Can verify certificates against public logs 	
- HTTP Public Key Pinning
	- (HPKP)
	- Deprecated by Google Chrome
- Cookies 
	- httponly - cannot be accessed by javascript.
- CSRF
	- Cross-Site Request Forgery - malicious exploit of a website or web application where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the web application trusts.
	- Cookies.
- XSS
	- XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.
	- Reflected XSS.
	- Persistent XSS.
	- DOM based /client-side XSS.
	- `<img scr=””>` will often load content from other websites, making a cross-origin HTTP request. 
- SQLi 
	- Person-in-the-browser (flash / java applets) (malware).
	- Validation / sanitisation of webforms.
- POST 
	- Form data. 
- GET 
	- Queries. 
	- Visible from URL.
- Directory traversal 
	- Find directories on the server you’re not meant to be able to see.
	- There are tools that do this.
- APIs 
	- Application Programming Interface.
	- Think about what information they return. 
	- And what can be sent.
- Beefhook
	- Get info about Chrome extensions.
- User agents
	- Is this a legitimate browser? Or a botnet?
- Browser extension take-overs
	- Miners, cred stealers, adware.
- Local file inclusion
	- LFI occurs when an application uses the path to a file as input. If the application treats this input as trusted, a local file may be used in the include statement.
- Remote file inclusion (not as common these days).
- SSRF 
	- Server Side Request Forgery.
- Web vuln scanners. 
- SQLmap.
- Malicious redirects.


# Infrastructure (Prod / Cloud) Virtualisation 

- Hypervisors
	-  type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
- Hyperjacking
	- malicious take over of a hypervisor.
- Containers, VMs, clusters.
	- Containers are a form of operating system virtualisation, a single container might be used to run anything from a microservice, software process, to a larger application.
	- VMs are software emulations of physical computers. Full copy of OS, applications, binaries, libraries, etc.
	- Clusters are groups of VM's working together to perform tasks such as complex simulations or serving web pages.
- Escaping techniques.
	- Network connections from VMs / containers.  
- Lateral movement and privilege escalation techniques.
	- Cloud Service Accounts can be used for lateral movement and privilege escalation in Cloud environments.
	- GCPloit tool for Google Cloud Projects.
- Site isolation
	- A site in this context can refer to physical location (like data center) or a logical concept (like a cloud platforms region or availability zone)
	- Main reasons for site isolation are Security (containing breach impact to one site), Performance (localising performance issues to regions), Fault Isolation (maintaining reliability and high availability after a fault on one site.
- Side-channel attacks.
	- Spectre: breaks the isolation between different applications. It allows an attacker to trick error-free programs, which follow best practices, into leaking their secrets. Spectre is more complex to exploit than Meltdown but also harder to mitigate. It affects almost every system, including desktops, laptops, cloud servers, and smartphones.
	- Meltdown: breaks the fundamental isolation between the user applications and the operating system. This attack allows a program to access the memory, and thus also the secrets, of other programs and the operating system. The vulnerability essentially melts security boundaries which are enforced by the hardware. Meltdown affects many systems, including desktops, laptops, and cloud computers.
	- Both attacks take advantage of the CPU's speculative execution mechanism, a feature designed to increase performance by executing instructions ahead of time. If certain conditions are met, the CPU will guess which instructions might be executed next and start executing them. If guessed wrong, it will roll back the changes as if nothing happened. However, this process can leave traces in the CPU's cache. An attacker can determine whether a particular piece of data is in the cache by measuring how long it takes to access memory. This is known as a side-channel attack.
- Beyondcorp 
	- BeyondCorp is a security model pioneered by Google that shifts access controls from the network perimeter to individual users and their devices. Instead of traditional methods where resources are located inside a secure corporate network and assumed safe, BeyondCorp does away with the idea of a trusted "internal network" and an "external network" that is less trusted.
	- The central idea behind BeyondCorp is to treat every access request as if it's coming from an open network, regardless of where the request originates or what network it's on. This means that every request for data is fully authenticated and authorised based on the user and the context of the request.
- Log4j vuln
	- Security issue in the Java logging package Log4j. Allows RCE on the server, this vulnerability was found in everything from banking systems to smart toasters. Wide spread due to the vulnerability lying in a trusted package.


# OS Implementation and Systems

- Privilege escalation techniques, and prevention.
- Buffer Overflows.
- Directory traversal (prevention).
- Remote Code Execution / getting shells.
- Local databases
	- Some messaging apps use sqlite for storing messages.
	- Useful for digital forensics, especially on phones.
- Windows
	- Windows registry and group policy.
	- Active Directory (AD).
		- Bloodhound tool. 
		- Kerberos authentication with AD.
	- Windows SMB. 
	- Samba (with SMB).
	- Buffer Overflows. 
	- ROP. 
	
- *nix 
	- SELinux.
	- Kernel, userspace, permissions.
	- MAC vs DAC.
	- /proc
	- /tmp - code can be saved here and executed.
	- /shadow 
	- LDAP - Lightweight Directory Browsing Protocol. Lets users have one password for many services. This is similar to Active Directory in windows.
- MacOS
	- Gotofail error (SSL).
	- MacSweeper.
	- Research Mac vulnerabilities.

## Mitigations 
- Patching 
- Data Execution Prevention
- Address space layout randomisation
	- To make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory.
- Principle of least privilege
	- Eg running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token. Reduces the ability of buffer overrun exploits to run as elevated user.
- Code signing
	- Requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.
- Compiler security features
	- Use of compilers that trap buffer overruns.
- Encryption
	- Of software and/or firmware components.
- Mandatory Access Controls
	- (MACs)
	- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	- Operating systems with Mandatory Access Controls - eg. SELinux.
- "Insecure by exception"
	- When to allow people to do certain things for their job, and how to improve everything else. Don't try to "fix" security, just improve it by 99%.
- Do not blame the user
	- Security is about protecting people, we should build technology that people can trust, not constantly blame users. 


# Cryptography, Authentication, Identity 

- Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing vs Obfuscation vs Signing
	- Be able to explain the differences between these things. 
	- [Various attack models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_model) (e.g. chosen-plaintext attack).

- Encryption standards + implementations
	- [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (asymmetrical).
	- [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (symmetrical).
	- [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA) (namely ed25519) (asymmetric).
	- [Chacha/Salsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant) (symmetric).

- Asymmetric vs symmetric
	- Asymmetric is slow, but good for establishing a trusted connection.
	- Symmetric has a shared key and is faster. Protocols often use asymmetric to transfer symmetric key.
	- Perfect forward secrecy - eg Signal uses this.

- Cyphers
	- Block vs stream [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher).
	- [Block cipher modes of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation).
	- [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode).

- Integrity and authenticity primitives
	- [Hashing functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) e.g. MD5, Sha-1, BLAKE. Used for identifiers, very useful for fingerprinting malware samples.
	- [Message Authentication Codes (MACs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code).
	- [Keyed-hash MAC (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

- Entropy
	- PRNG (pseudo random number generators).
	- Entropy buffer draining.
	- Methods of filling entropy buffer.

- Authentication
	- Certificates 
		- What info do certs contain, how are they signed? 
		- Look at DigiNotar.
	- Trusted Platform Module 
		- (TPM)
		- Trusted storage for certs and auth data locally on device/host.
	- O-auth
		- Bearer tokens, this can be stolen and used, just like cookies.
	- Auth Cookies
		- Client side.
	- Sessions 
		- Server side.
	- Auth systems 
		- SAMLv2o.
		- OpenID.
		- Kerberos. 
			- Gold & silver tickets.
			- Mimikatz.
			- Pass-the-hash.	  
	- Biometrics
		- Can't rotate unlike passwords.
	- Password management
		- Rotating passwords (and why this is bad).

# Detection

- IDS
	- Intrusion Detection System (signature based (eg. snort) or behaviour based).
	- Snort/Suricata/YARA rule writing
	- Host-based Intrusion Detection System (eg. OSSEC)

- SIEM
	- Security Information and Event Management.

- IOC 
	- Indicator of compromise (often shared amongst orgs/groups).
	- Specific details (e.g. IP addresses, hashes, domains)

- Things that create signals
	- Honeypots, snort.

- Things that triage signals
	- SIEM, eg splunk.

- Things that will alert a human 
	- Automatic triage of collated logs, machine learning.
	- Notifications and analyst fatigue.
	- Systems that make it easy to decide if alert is actual hacks or not.

- Signatures
	- Host-based signatures
		- Eg changes to the registry, files created or modified.
		- Strings in found in malware samples appearing in binaries installed on hosts (/Antivirus).
	- Network signatures
		- Eg checking DNS records for attempts to contact C2 (command and control) servers. 

- Anomaly / Behaviour based detection 
	- IDS learns model of “normal” behaviour, then can detect things that deviate too far from normal - eg unusual urls being accessed, user specific- login times / usual work hours, normal files accessed.  
	- Can also look for things that a hacker might specifically do (eg, HISTFILE commands, accessing /proc).
	- If someone is inside the network- If action could be suspicious, increase log verbosity for that user.

- Firewall rules
	- Brute force (trying to log in with a lot of failures).
	- Detecting port scanning (could look for TCP SYN packets with no following SYN ACK/ half connections).
	- Antivirus software notifications.
	- Large amounts of upload traffic.

- Honey pots
	- Canary tokens.
	- Dummy internal service / web server, can check traffic, see what attacker tries.

- Things to know about attackers
	- Slow attacks are harder to detect.
	- Attacker can spoof packets that look like other types of attacks, deliberately create a lot of noise.
	- Attacker can spoof IP address sending packets, but can check TTL of packets and TTL of reverse lookup to find spoofed addresses.
	- Correlating IPs with physical location (is difficult and inaccurate often).

- Logs to look at
	- DNS queries to suspicious domains.
	- HTTP headers could contain wonky information.
	- Metadata of files (eg. author of file) (more forensics?).
	- Traffic volume.
	- Traffic patterns.
	- Execution logs.

- Detection related tools
	- Splunk.
	- Arcsight.
	- Qradar.
	- Darktrace.
	- Tcpdump.
	- Wireshark.
	- Zeek.

- Run a scenario from A to Z, how would you ...

- Good practices for running incidents 
	- How to delegate.
	- Who does what role.
	- How is communication managed + methods of communication.
	- When to stop an attack.
	- Understand risk of alerting attacker.
	- Ways an attacker may clean up / hide their attack.
	- When / how to inform upper management (manage expectations).

	- Use playbooks if available

- Important things to know and understand
	- Type of alerts, how these are triggered.
	- Finding the root cause.
	- Understand stages of an attack (e.g. cyber-killchain)
	- Symptom vs Cause.
	- First principles vs in depth systems knowledge (why both are good).
	- Building timeline of events.

# Security Operations
- Where to start with planning a SecOps Function
	- Create a Strong Mission Statement and understand what you are trying to achieve.
   	- **Phase 1: Establish Baseline SOC Capabilities**
   		- Ensure visibility of key assets, infrastructure, and threats.
   	 	- If you already know some logging costs are going to be excessive, define use cases early and often during log onboarding so you can trim logs fast.
   	  	- Using a framework like [DeTTEC](https://github.com/rabobank-cdc/DeTTECT) to map threats, logging, and mitigations provides a good starting point for gap analysis.
   	  	- Define clear incident response playbooks and procedures, suggest using NIST, SANS PICERL, or IMAG as a framework.
   	  	- Configure some automated responses, connetors, and low effort logic at this point to help productivity.
   	  	- Start measuring and tracking KPIs (Mean time to detection/remediation, False Positive rate) and define what else you want to track, even if you cannot do it at this stage. *Raw stats like how many alerts and how many an analyst deals with are usually low value and lead to unwanted anti patterns.
  	- **Phase 2: Threat Intel and Threat Hunting**
   	  	- Establish threat informed decision making and shift from reactive to proactive.
   	   	- Set up and configure a Threat Intelligence Platform.
   	    	- Automate indicator ingestion and enrichment into your SIEM, add tags, etc.
   	     	- From operational intelligence and reports start creating a threat hunt process/procedure.
   	      	- Define and implement workflows for to improve SOC detection engineering, using [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) mapping to ensure coverage of known TTPs.
   	      	- Create custom detections based on intelligence and organisational context.
   	- **Phase 3: Continuous improvement**
   		- Automate and optimise SOC processes based on intelligence from KPIs/Metrics and the TIP.
   	 	- Automate the pain away (repetive tasks, well defined processes).
   	  	- Enrich SIEM incidents to increase single pane of glass goal.
   	  	- Attempt to reduce FP rate further.
   	  	- Conduct Red/Purple Team exercises
   	  	- Alternative is to use something like [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) or [Atomic Threat Coverage](https://github.com/atc-project/atomic-threat-coverage).
   	  	- Develop continuous improvement plan for the SOC - including team member expertise and career progression.
   	  	- Include proper post mortems in major incidents and near misses.

- Malware signatures
	- A program that looks for malware signatures in binaries and code samples.
	- Look at Yara rules for examples.

Put your work-in-progress scripts on GitHub and link to them on your resume/CV. Resist the urge to make your scripts perfect or complete before doing this.

# Leader - Leader Model

It should be noted that everyone has a different leadership style. I prefer to lean on the expertise, experience, and context of my team, and empower them to make right decisions - where I become an enabler/force-multiplier for their efforts.
**Ensure clarity of mission and objectives - so that every decision ties directly back to overarching goals, no matter who initiates it.**
Leader - Leader model, which can be summarised as:
1. Distributing Authority and Decision-Making
	1. Shift from getting permission to "I intend to..."
	2. Empower those closest to the operational details
2. Establish clear goals and expectations
3. Emphasise technical and contextual knowledge
4. Greater freedom for team members to propose and ACT on their ideas, but also demands greater personal responsibility
5. Reduces bottlenecks for initiatives, increases agility, and develops leadership skills across the team
6. Iterative Feedback loops should be promoted with open dialogue among all ranks (feedback should be immediate and constructive)
7. With ownership, team members are mor inclined to suggest process improvements, take calculated risks, and experiment responsibly to enhance performance.

Shift language from permission seeking to initiative.
Develop team members competence.
Ensure clarity of mission and objectives - so that every decision ties directly back to overarching goals, no matter who initiates it.
Instil accountability, individuals must own results that are both positive and negative. _But failing should not be seen as a negative outcome_, so long as something was learned from it.
